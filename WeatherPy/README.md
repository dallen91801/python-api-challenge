TEMPURATURE
Northern Hemisphere: Temperature vs. Latitude

Plot Analysis:
In this plot, the linear regression is modeling the relationship between latitude (x-axis) and temperature (y-axis) for cities in the Northern Hemisphere (latitude ≥ 0).

Linear Regression Summary:
Slope: The slope is negative, indicating that as latitude increases (moving away from the equator), temperature decreases.
R² Value: The R² value is relatively high, showing that latitude is a strong predictor of temperature in the Northern Hemisphere.

Findings:

Inverse Relationship: There is a clear inverse relationship between latitude and temperature. The further a city is from the equator, the lower its temperature tends to be.
Strong Predictive Power: Latitude explains a significant portion of the temperature variability, which is expected because regions farther from the equator receive less solar energy, leading to cooler temperatures.

Southern Hemisphere: Temperature vs. Latitude

Plot Analysis:
This plot models the relationship between latitude and temperature in the Southern Hemisphere (latitude < 0).

Linear Regression Summary:
Slope: The slope is positive, indicating that as latitude increases (moving towards the equator from negative values), temperature increases.
R² Value: The R² value is relatively high, similar to the Northern Hemisphere, showing that latitude strongly predicts temperature.

Findings:
Positive Relationship: In the Southern Hemisphere, as latitude approaches 0 (closer to the equator), temperatures increase, following a similar but inverted trend compared to the Northern Hemisphere.

Equator Effect: Just like in the Northern Hemisphere, proximity to the equator results in warmer temperatures, highlighting the symmetrical nature of global temperature patterns around the equator.

HUMIDITY
Northern Hemisphere: Humidity vs. Latitude

Plot Analysis:
This plot models the relationship between latitude and humidity in the Northern Hemisphere.
Linear Regression Summary:
Slope: The slope may be close to zero, indicating little to no change in humidity with increasing latitude.
R² Value: The R² value is quite low, suggesting a weak correlation between latitude and humidity.

Findings:
Weak or No Relationship: The relationship between latitude and humidity in the Northern Hemisphere is weak. Humidity is not primarily driven by latitude; instead, it depends on local factors like proximity to water bodies, altitude, and prevailing weather patterns.
Variability in Humidity: Humidity levels vary significantly across different latitudes, but there is no clear trend as you move away from the equator.

Southern Hemisphere: Humidity vs. Latitude
Plot Analysis:
This plot models the relationship between latitude and humidity in the Southern Hemisphere.

Linear Regression Summary:
Slope: Similar to the Northern Hemisphere, the slope is close to zero, showing little change in humidity with latitude.
R² Value: The R² value is also low, indicating a weak relationship.

Findings:
No Significant Trend: Like in the Northern Hemisphere, there is no strong correlation between latitude and humidity. Local meteorological factors dominate the variations in humidity levels.

Humidity Varies by Region: Humidity does not increase or decrease in any meaningful way as latitude changes, suggesting that factors such as ocean currents, wind patterns, and regional geography play a more critical role.
Northern Hemisphere: Cloudiness vs. Latitude

CLOUDINESS
Plot Analysis:
This plot models the relationship between latitude and cloudiness in the Northern Hemisphere.

Linear Regression Summary:
Slope: The slope is close to zero, indicating that cloudiness does not change significantly with latitude.
R² Value: The R² value is very low, indicating a weak correlation.

Findings:
No Strong Relationship: Latitude does not appear to influence cloudiness in the Northern Hemisphere. Cloud cover is influenced more by local weather conditions, geography, and oceanic patterns than by latitude.

Highly Variable Cloudiness: Cloudiness levels fluctuate across different latitudes with no clear trend, making latitude a poor predictor for cloudiness.

Southern Hemisphere: Cloudiness vs. Latitude

Plot Analysis:
This plot models the relationship between latitude and cloudiness in the Southern Hemisphere.

Linear Regression Summary:
Slope: Similar to the Northern Hemisphere, the slope is close to zero, showing no significant relationship between latitude and cloudiness.
R² Value: The R² value is low, indicating that latitude explains very little of the variability in cloudiness.

Findings:
Similar to Northern Hemisphere: Like in the Northern Hemisphere, cloudiness in the Southern Hemisphere shows no strong relationship with latitude.

Influence of Local Weather Systems: Cloud cover is driven by complex regional factors such as wind patterns, proximity to oceans, and mountain ranges, not latitude.

WIND SPEED
Northern Hemisphere: Wind Speed vs. Latitude

Plot Analysis:
This plot models the relationship between latitude and wind speed in the Northern Hemisphere.
Linear Regression Summary:

Slope: The slope could be slightly positive or negative, depending on the data, but it's generally small.
R² Value: The R² value is low, indicating a weak correlation between latitude and wind speed.

Findings:
No Strong Trend: There is no strong relationship between latitude and wind speed. Wind speeds are more influenced by local geographical features (e.g., mountains, valleys) and regional weather patterns (e.g., storms, trade winds) rather than latitude alone.
Localized Variability: Wind speeds are highly variable across latitudes, showing that latitude does not explain most of the differences in wind speed.

Southern Hemisphere: Wind Speed vs. Latitude

Plot Analysis:
This plot models the relationship between latitude and wind speed in the Southern Hemisphere.
Linear Regression Summary:
Slope: The slope is small, suggesting no significant change in wind speed with latitude.
R² Value: The R² value is also low, showing little correlation between latitude and wind speed.
Findings:

Weak Correlation: Like in the Northern Hemisphere, latitude does not strongly influence wind speed in the Southern Hemisphere. Wind speeds are influenced by local weather systems, storms, and regional topography rather than latitude.
Wind Patterns: Global wind patterns, such as the trade winds and the westerlies, are more complex than a simple relationship with latitude, which is why wind speed doesn't show a clear trend.

Summary of Findings:

Temperature: Latitude shows a strong inverse relationship with temperature in both hemispheres. As you move further from the equator, temperatures decrease (Northern Hemisphere) or increase (Southern Hemisphere).

Humidity, Cloudiness, Wind Speed: These weather variables show little to no correlation with latitude in both hemispheres. Local and regional factors like geography, ocean currents, and weather systems have a far greater influence on humidity, cloudiness, and wind speed than latitude does.

The linear regression models suggest that latitude is a good predictor for temperature but not for humidity, cloudiness, or wind speed. The findings reinforce the idea that while latitude influences solar energy and thus temperature, other weather phenomena are controlled by more localized factors.
